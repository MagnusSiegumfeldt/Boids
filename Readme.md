# A flocking visualization: Boids
This is a p5.js implementation of the Boids simulation described by Craig Reynolds.

Each boid behaves by 3 simple rules:
* Cohesion: Steer towards the center of your flockmates
* Separation: Steer to avoid crashing into your flockmates
* Alignment: Steer to align with your flockmates

My implementation is a simple visual implementation allowing you to change the simple settings of the simulation.
